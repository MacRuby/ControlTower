For 0.1:

[ ] Logging!
  [ ] An ASL-based Logger class (?)
  [ ] Request logging (maybe? this is also handled by Rack::CommonLogger)
  [ ] Debug logging
  [ ] Benchmark logging
[ ] Testing!
  [ ] Parser test cases
  [ ] GET test cases
  [ ] POST test cases
  [ ] Concurrency testing
[X] Handle broken request pipes
[X] Don't reset peer connections
[X] Handle multibyte characters in headers
[X] Improve body loading
[X] Be smarter about using Tempfiles vs StringIO for request body

For beyond:
[ ] Daemonizable!
[ ] Accept local requests only
[ ] Keep alive (this one is tough...probably post 1.0)
